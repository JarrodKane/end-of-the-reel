Tasty podcast site made with next.js, tailwindcss, and TypeScript.

It's current a work in progress, the todos section have some of what's left to do.

Goal of this site was to get a modern clean podcast site, drawing a lot of inspiration from:
[Here Be Monsters](https://www.hbmpodcast.com/)
[Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/)

This site grabs the RSS feed from Pinecast and then creates the pages for the episodes.

Eventually I would like to allow people to use this as a template for them to take and put in their own podcast from pinecast.
I'll need to build a basic backend for them to sign into and do that work, that's a bit later down the track
